## Task 3: Object Localization

Task 3 combines the two previous tasks. The drone should maneuver through the maze to multiple goals, and report the detected numbers. A map of the maze will be provided, in the same way as in task 1.

# Scoring

All tasks will have a scoring system based on how well the tasks are being completed based on the provided maps/data provided during the weekend. This is to give teams some indication of how well they are doing compared to each other.  

However, the final scoreboard will be calculated based on new maps/data which will be provided once the coding time is over. It is therefore important to keep in mind that the code should be robust to new maps/data.
